# Pre-Registration

## Overview

This module enables a resident to:

* Enter demographic data & upload supporting documents
* Book an appointment for one or many users for registration by choosing a suitable registration center and time slot
* Receive appointment notifications
* Reschedule and cancel appointments

Resident data is sent to the designated registration center before appointment that can be used during the registration process.
