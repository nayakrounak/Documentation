A MOSIP compliant device would follow the standards established in this document. It is expected that the devices are compliant to this specification and tested and validated. The details of each of these are outlined in the subsequent sections.

### Device Capability

The MOSIP compliant device is expected to perform the following:

* Should have the ability to collect one or more biometric
* Should have the ability to sign the captured biometric image or template.
* Should have the ability to protect secret keys
* Should have no mechanism to inject the biometric

We recommend that countries look at ergonomics, accessibility, ease of usage, and common availability of devices while choosing devices for use in registration and authentication scenarios.

## Device Trust

MOSIP compliant devices provide a trust environment for the devices to be used in registration, KYC and AUTH scenarios. The trust level is established based on the device support for trusted execution.

* L1 - The trust is provided by a secure chip with secure execution environment.
* L2 - The trust is provided by a secure chip with secure execution environment and complete tamper protection and responsive across the entire device.
* L0 - The trust is provided at the software level. No hardware related trust exist. This type of compliance is used in controlled environments.

### Foundational Trust Module \(FTM\)

The foundational trust module would be created using a secure microprocessor capable of performing all required biometric processing and secure storage of keys. The foundational device trust would satisfy the below requirements.

* The module has the ability to securely generate, store and process cryptographic keys.
* Generation of asymmetric keys and symmetric keys with TRNG.
* The module has the ability to protect keys from extraction.
* The module has to protect the keys from physical tampering, temperature, frequency and voltage related attacks.
* The module could withstand against Hardware cloning.
* The module could withstand probing attacks
* The module provides memory segregation for cryptographic operations and protection against buffer over flow attacks
* The module provides ability to withstand cryptographic side channel attacks like Differential Power analysis attacks, Timing attacks.
* CAVP validated implementation of the cryptographic algorithm.
* The module has the ability to perform a cryptographically validatable secure boot.
* The module has the ability to run trusted applications.

The foundational device trust derived from this module is used to enable trust-based computing for biometric capture. The foundational device trust module provides for a trusted execution environment based on the following:

* Secure Boot
  * Ability to cryptographically verify code before execution.
  * Ability to check for integrity violation of the module/device.
  * Halt upon failure.
  * Ability to securely upgrade and perform forward only upgrades, to thwart downgrade attacks.
  * SHA256 hash equivalent or above should be used for all hashing requirements
  * All root of trust is provisioned upon first boot or before.
  * All upgrades would be considered success only after the successful boot with proper hash and signature verification.
  * The boot should fail upon hash/signature failures and would never operate in a intermediary state.
  * Maximum of 10 failed attempts should lock the upgrade process and brick the device. However chip manufactures can decide to be less than 10.
* Secure application
  * Ability to run applications that are trusted.
  * Protect against downgrading of applications.
  * Isolated memory to support cryptographic operations.
  * All trust are anchored during the first boot and not modifiable.

#### Certification

The FTM should have a at least one of the following certifications in each category to meet the given requirement.

**Category: Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation**

* CAVP \(RSA, AES, SHA256, TRNG \(DRBGVS\), ECC\)

{% hint style="info" %}
The supported algorithm and curves are listed [here](mosip-device-service-specification.md#cryptography)
{% endhint %}

**Category: FTM Chip**

* FIPS 140-2 L3 or above
* PCI PTS 5 or above \(Pre-certified\)
* Common Criteria \(EAL4 and above\)
  * TODO:FILL IN

**Category: Tamper**

* For L1 level compliance the FTM should support tamper evidence.
* For L2 level compliance the FTM should support all of L1 and capabilities to adopt tamper responsiveness.

#### Threats to Protect

The FTM should protect against the following threats.

* Hardware cloning attacks - Ability to protect against attacks that could result in a duplicate with keys.
* Hardware Tamper attacks
  * Physical tamper - No way to physically tamper and obtain it secrets. 
  * Voltage & frequency related attacks - Should shield against voltage leaks and should prevent against low voltage. The FTM should always be in either of the state operational normally or inoperable. The FTM should never be operable when its input voltages are not met.
  * Temperature attacks on crypto block - Low or High the FTM is expected to operate or reach inoperable state. No state in between.
* Differential Power Analysis attack.
* Probing attacks - FTM should protect its surface area against any probe related attacks.
* Segregation of memory for execution of cryptographic operation \(crypto block should be protected from buffer overflow type attacks\).
* Vulnerability of the cryptographic algorithm implementation.
* Attacks against secure boot & secure upgrade.
* TEE/Secure processor OS attack.

#### Foundational Trust Module Identity

Upon an FTM provider approved by the MOSIP adopters, the FTM provider would submit a self signed public certificate to the adopter. Let us call this as the FTM root. The adopter would use this certificate to seed their device trust database. The FTM root and their key pairs should be generated and stored in FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or more compliant devices with no possible mechanism to extract the keys. The foundational module upon its first boot is expected to generate a random asymmetric key pair and provide the public part of the key to obtain a valid certificate. The FTM provider would validate to ensure that the chip is unique and would issue a certificate with the issuer set to FTM root. The entire certificate issuance would be in a secured provisioning facility. Auditable upon notice by the adopters or its approved auditors. The certificate issued to the module will have a defined validity period as per the MOSIP certificate policy document defined by the MOSIP adopters. This certificate and private key within the FTM chip is expected to be in it permanent memory.

{% hint style="info" %}
The validity for the chip certificate can not exceed 20 years from the date of manufacturing.
{% endhint %}

### Device

Mosip devices are most often used to collect biometrics. The devices are expected to follow the specification for all level of compliance and its usage. The mosip devices fall under the category of Trust Level 3 \(TL3\) as defined in MOSIP architecture. At TL3 device is expected to be whitelisted with a fully capable PKI and secure storage of keys at the hardware.

* L0 - A device can obtain L0 certification when it uses software level cryptographic library with no secure boot or FTM.  These devices will follow different device identity and the same would be mentioned as part of exception flows.
* L1 - A device can obtain L1 certification when its built in secure facility with one of the certified FTM.
* L2 - A device can obtain L2 certification when its build in secure facility with one of the certified FTM with tamper responsiveness. Also the device should be capable of demonstrating tamper responsiveness during its entire life time.

#### Device Identity

It is imperative that all devices that connect to MOSIP are identifiable. MOSIP believes in cryptographic Identity as its basis for trust.

**Physical ID**

An identification mark that shows MOSIP compliance and a readable unique device serial number \(minimum of 12 digits\), make and model. The same information has to be available over a 2D QR Code or Barcode. This is to help field support and validation.

**Digital ID**

A digital device ID in MOSIP would be a signed JSON \(RFC 7515\) as follows:

```javascript
{
  "serialNo": "Serial number",
  "make": "Make of the device",
  "model": "Model of the device",
  "type": "Type of the biometric device",
  "deviceSubType": "Subtypes of the biometric device",
  "deviceProvider": "Device provider name",
  "deviceProviderId": "Device provider id",
  "dateTime": "Datetime in ISO format with timezone. Identity request time"
}
```

Signed with the JSON Web Signature \(RFC 7515\) using the "Foundational Trust Module" Identity key, this data is the fundamental identity of the device. Every MOSIP compliant device will need the foundational trust module.

The only exception to this rule is for the L0 compliant devices that have the purpose \(explained below during device registration\) as "Registration". L0 devices would sign the Digital Id with the device key.

Signed Digital ID would look as follows:

```text
"digitalId": "base64urlencoded(header).base64urlencoded(payload).base64urlencoded(signature)"
```

The header in the digital id would have:

```text
"alg": "RS256",
"type": "JWT",
"x5c": "<Certificate of the FTM chip, If in case the chain of certificates are sent then the same will be ignored">
```

MOSIP assumes that the first certificate in the x5c is the FTM's chip public certificate issued by the FTM root certificate.

Unsigned digital ID would look as follows:

```text
"digitalId": "base64urlencoded(payload)"
```

Payload is the Digital ID JSON object.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a L0 unregistered device the digital id will be unsigned. In all other scenarios, except for a discovery call, the digital ID will be signed either by the chip key \(L1\) or the device key \(L0\).
{% endhint %}

### Keys

List of keys used in the device and their explanation.

* **Device Key**

Each biometric device would contain an authorized private key after the device registration. This key is rotated frequently based on the requirement from the respective adopter of MOSIP. By default MOSIP recommends 30 days key rotation policy for the device key. The device keys are created by the device providers inside the FTM during a successful registration. The device keys are used for signing the biometric. More details of the signing and its usage will be [here](mosip-device-service-specification.md#device-service-communication-interfaces). This key is issued by the device provider and the certificate of the device key is issued by the device provider key which in turn is issued by the MOSIP adopter after approval of the device providers specific model.

* **FTM Key**

The FTM key is the root of the identity. This key is created by the FTM provider during the manufacturing/provisioning stage. This is a permanent key and would never be rotated. This key is used to sign the Digital ID.

* **MOSIP Key**

The MOSIP key is the public key provided by the MOSIP adopter. This key is used to encrypt the biometric biometric. Details of the encryption is listed below. We recommend to rotate this key every 1 year.

## Device Service - Communication Interfaces

The section explains the necessary details of the biometric device connectivity, accessibility, discover-ability and protocols used to build and communicate with the device.

The device should implement only the following set of APIs. All the APIâ€™s are independent of the physical layer and the operating system, with the invocation being different across operating systems. While the operating system names are defined in this spec a similar technology can be used for unspecified operating systems. It is expected that the device service ensures that the device is connected locally to the host.

### Device Discovery

Device discovery would be used to identify MOSIP compliant devices in a system by the applications. The protocol is designed as simple plug and play with all the necessary abstraction to the specifics.

#### Device Discovery Request

```javascript
{
  "type": "type of the device"
}
```

#### Accepted Values for Device Discovery Request

* type - "Biometric Device", "Finger", "Face", "Iris"

{% hint style="info" %}
"Biometric Device" - is a special type and used in case if you are looking for any biometric device.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* The response is an array that we could have a single device enumerating with multiple biometric options.

{% endhint %}

#### Windows/Linux

All the device API will be based on the HTTP specification. The device always binds to with any of the available ports ranging from 4501 - 4600. The IP address used for binding has to be 127.0.0.1 and not localhost.

The applications that require access to MOSIP devices could discover them by sending the HTTP request to the supported port range. We will call this port as the device\_service\_port in the rest of the document.

_**HTTP Request:**_

```text
MOSIPDISC http://127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>/device
HOST: 127.0.0.1: <device_service_port>
EXT: <app name>
```

_**HTTP Response:**_

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
CACHE-CONTROL:no-store
LOCATION:http://127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>
Content-Length: length in bytes of the body
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: Closed
```

{% hint style="info" %}
* The pay loads are JSON in both the cases and are part of the body.
* CallbackId would be set to the `http://127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>`. So, the caller will use the respective HTTP verb / method and the URL to call the service.
{% endhint %}

#### Android

All devices on an android device should listen to the following intent "io.mosip.device".

Upon invocation of this intent the devices are expected to respond back with the json response filtered by the respective type.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Android, the CallbackId would be set to the appId. So, the caller will create the intent "appId.Info" or "appId.Capture".
{% endhint %}

#### IOS

All device on an IOS device would respond to the URL schema as follows:

```text
MOSIPDISC://<call-back-app-url>?ext=<caller app name>&type=<type as defined in mosip device request>
```

If a MOSIP compliant device service app exist then the URL would launch the service. The service in return should respond back to the caller using the call-back-app-url with the base64 encoded json as the URL parameter for the key data.

{% hint style="info" %}
* In IOS there are restrictions to have multiple apps registering to the same URL schema.
* CallbackId would be set to the device service appname. So, the caller has to call appnameInfo or appnameCapture as the URL scheme.
{% endhint %}

### Device Info

The device information API would be used to identify the MOSIP compliant devices and their status by the applications.

#### Device Info Response

```text
[
  {
    "deviceInfo": {
      "deviceStatus": "Current status",
      "deviceId": "Internal ID",
      "firmware": "Firmware version",
      "certification": "Certification level",
      "serviceVersion": "Device service version",
      "deviceSubId": ["Array of supported device sub Ids"],
      "callbackId": "Baseurl to reach to the device",
      "digitalId": "Signed digital id as described in the digital id section of this document.",
      "deviceCode": "A unique code given by MOSIP after successful registration",
      "env": "Target environment",
      "purpose": "Auth  or Registration",
      "specVersion": ["Array of supported MDS specification version"],
    },
    "error": {
      "errorCode": "101",
      "errorInfo": "Invalid JSON Value "
    }
  }
  ...
]
```

The final JSON is signed with the JSON web signature using the "Foundational Trust Module" Identity key, this data is the fundamental identity of the device. Every MOSIP compliant device will need the foundational trust module.

So the API would respond in the following format.

```text
[
  {
    "deviceInfo": "base64urlencode(header).base64urlencode(payload).base64urlencode(signature)"
    "error": {
      "errorCode": "100",
      "errorInfo": "Device not registered. In this case the device info will be only base64urlencode(payload)"
    }
  }
]
```

{% endhint %}

#### Windows/Linux

The applications that require more details of the MOSIP devices could get them by sending the HTTP request to the supported port range. The device always binds to with any of the available ports ranging from 4501 - 4600. The IP address used for binding has to be 127.0.0.1 and not localhost.

_**HTTP Request:**_

```text
MOSIPDINFO http://127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>/info
HOST: 127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>
EXT: <app name>
```

_**HTTP Response:**_

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
CACHE-CONTROL:no-store
LOCATION:http://127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>
Content-Length: length in bytes of the body
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: Closed
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The pay loads are JSON in both the cases and are part of the body.
{% endhint %}

#### Android

On an android device should listen to the following intent "appId.Info".

Upon invocation of this intent the devices are expected to respond back with the JSON response filtered by the respective type.

#### IOS

On an IOS device would respond to the URL schema as follows:

```text
APPIDINFO://<call-back-app-url>?ext=<caller app name>&type=<type as defined in mosip device request>
```

If a MOSIP compliant device service app exist then the URL would launch the service. The service in return should respond back to the called using the call-back-app-url with the base64 encoded JSON as the URL parameter for the key data.

{% hint style="info" %}
In IOS there are restrictions to have multiple app registering to the same URL schema.
{% endhint %}

### Capture

The capture request would be used to capture a biometric from MOSIP compliant devices by the applications. The capture call will respond with success to only one call at a time. So, in case of a parallel call the device info details are sent with status as "Busy".

#### Capture Request

```text
{
  "env": "Target environment",
  "purpose": "Auth  or Registration",
  "specVersion": "Expected version of the MDS spec",
  "timeout" : "Timeout for capture",
  "captureTime": "Time of capture request in ISO format including timezone",
  "domainUri": "URI of the auth server",
  "transactionId": "Transaction Id for the current capture",
  "bio": [
    {
      "type": "Type of the biometric data",
      "count":  "Finger/Iris count, in case of face max is set to 1",
      "bioSubType": ["Array of subtypes"],
      "requestedScore": "Expected quality score that should match to complete a successful capture",
      "deviceId": "Internal Id",
      "deviceSubId": "Specific Device Sub Id",
      "previousHash": "Hash of the previous block"
    }
  ],
  customOpts: {
    //Max of 50 key value pair. This is so that vendor specific parameters can be sent if necessary. The values cannot be hard coded and have to be configured by the apps server and should be modifiable upon need by the applications. Vendors are free to include additional parameters and fine-tuning parameters. None of these values should go undocumented by the vendor. No sensitive data should be available in the customOpts.
  }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Count value should be driven by the count of the bioSubType for Iris and Finger. For Face, there will be no bioSubType but the count should be "1".

The entire data object is sent in JWT format. So, the data object will look like:

```text
"data" : "base64urlencode(header).base64urlencode(payload).base64urlencode(signature)
payload - is defined as the entire byte array of data block.
```

#### Windows/Linux

The applications that requires to capture biometric data from a MOSIP devices could do so by sending the HTTP request to the supported port range.

_**HTTP Request:**_

```text
CAPTURE [http://127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>/capture](http://127.0.0.1/capture)
HOST: 127.0.0.1: <apps port>
EXT: <app name>
```

_**HTTP Response:**_

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
CACHE-CONTROL:no-store
LOCATION:[http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1):<device_service_port>
Content-Length: length in bytes of the body
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: Closed
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The pay loads are JSON in both the cases and are part of the body.
{% endhint %}

#### Android

All device on an android device should listen to the following intent appid.capture. Upon this intend the devices are expected to respond back with the JSON response filtered by the respective type.

#### IOS

All device on an IOS device would respond to the URL schema as follows.

```text
APPIDCAPTURE://<call-back-app-url>?ext=<caller app name>&type=<type as defined in mosip device request>
```

If a MOSIP compliant device service app exist then the URL would launch the service. The service in return should respond back to the called using the call-back-app-url with the base64 encoded json as the URL parameter for the key data.

### Device Stream

The device would open a stream channel to send the live video streams. This would help when there is an assisted operation to collect biometric. Please note the stream APIâ€™s are available only for registration environment.

Used only for the registration module compatible devices. This API is visible only for the devices that are registered for the purpose as "Registration".

#### Device Stream Request

```text
{
  "deviceId": "Internal Id",
  "deviceSubId": "Specific device sub Id",
  "timeout": "Timeout for stream"
}
```

#### Device Stream Response

Live Video stream with quality of 3 frames per second or more using [M-JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG).

{% hint style="info" %}
Preview should have the quality markings and segment marking. The preview would also be used to display any error message to the user screen. All error messages should be localized.
{% endhint %}

#### Error Response for Device Stream

```text
{
  "error": {
    "errorCode": "202",
    "errorInfo": "No Device Connected."
  }
}
```

#### Windows/Linux

The applications that require more details of the MOSIP devices could get them by sending the HTTP request to the supported port range.

_**HTTP Request:**_

```text
STREAM   http://127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>/stream
HOST: 127.0.0.1: <apps port>
EXT: <app name>
```

_**HTTP Response:**_ HTTP Chunk of frames to be displayed. Minimum frames 3 per second.

#### Android

No support for streaming

#### IOS

No support for streaming

### Registration Capture

The registration client application will discover the device. Once the device is discovered the status of the device is obtained with the device info API. During the registration the registration client sends the RCAPTURE API and the response will provide the actual biometric data in a digitally signed non encrypted form. When the Device Registration Capture API is called the frames should not be added to the stream. The device is expected to send the images in ISO format.

The requestedScore is in the scale of 1-100. So, in cases where you have four fingers the average of all will be considered for capture threshold. The device would always send the best frame during the capture time even if the requested score is not met.

The API is used by the devices that are compatible for the registration module. This API should not be supported by the devices that are compatible for authentication.

## Management Server and Management Client

### Management Server Functionalities and Interactions

The management server has the following objectives.

1. Validate the devices to ensure its a genuine device from the respective device provider. This can be achieved using the device info and the certificates for the Foundational Trust Module.
2. Register the genuine device with the MOSIP device server.
3. Manage/Sync time between the end device the server. The time to be synced should be the only trusted time accepted by the device.
4. Ability to issue commands to the end device for
   1. De-registration of the device \(Device Keys\)
   2. Collect device information to maintain, manage, support and upgrade a device remotely.
5. A central repository of all the approved devices from the device provider.
6. Safe storage of keys using HSM FIPS 140-2 Level 3. These keys are used to issue the device certificate upon registration.

   The Management Server is created and hosted by the device provider outside of MOSIP software. The communication protocols between the MDS and the Management Server can be decided by the respective device provider. Such communication should be restricted to the above specified interactions only. No transactional information should be sent to this server.

7. Should have the ability to push updates from the server to the client devices.

### Management Client

Management client is the interface that connects the device with the respective management server. Its important that the communication between the management server and its clients are designed with scalability, robustness, performance and security. The management server may add many more capabilities than what is described here, But the basic security objectives should be met at all times irrespective of the offerings.

1. For better and efficient handling of device at large volume, we expect the devices to auto register to the Management server.
2. All communication to the server and from the server should follow that below properties.
   1. All communication are digitally signed with the approved algorithms
   2. All communication to the server are encrypted using one of the approved public key cryptography \(HTTPS â€“ TLS1.2/1.3 is required with one of the [approved algorithms](mosip-device-service-specification.md#cryptography).
   3. All request has timestamps attached in ISO format to the milliseconds inside the signature.
   4. All communication back and fourth should have the signed digital id as one of the attribute.
3. Its expected that the auto registration has an absolute way to identify and validate the devices.
4. The management client should be able to detect the devices in a plug and play model.
5. All key rotation should be triggered from the server.
6. Should have the ability to detect if its speaking to the right management server.
7. All upgrades should be verifiable and the client should have ability to verify software upgrades.
8. Should not allow any downgrade of software.
9. Should not expose any API to capture biometric. The management server should have no ability to trigger a capture request.
10. No logging of biometric data is allowed. \(Both in the encrypted and unencrypted format\)

## Compliance

**L2 Certified Device / L2 Device** - A device certified as capable of performing encryption on the device inside its trusted zone with tamper responsive features.   
 **L1 Certified Device / L1 Device** - A device certified as capable of performing encryption on the device inside its trusted zone.   
 **L0 Certified Device / L0 Device** - A device certified as one where the encryption is done on the host inside its device driver or the MOSIP device service.

### Secure Provisioning

Secure provisioning is applicable to both the FTM and the Device providers.

1. The devices and FTM should have a mechanism to protect against fraudulent attempts to create or replicate.
2. The device and FTM trust should be programmed in a secure facility which is certified by the respective MOSIP adopters.
3. Organization should have mechanism to segregate the FTM's and Devices built for MOSIP using cryptographically valid and repeatable process.
4. All debug options within the FTM or device should be disabled permanently
5. All key creations need for provisioning should happen automatically using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or higher devices. No individual or a group or organization should have mechanism to influence this behavior.
6. Before the devices/FTM leaving the secure provisioning facility all the necessary trust should be established and should not be re-programmable.

### Compliance Level

| API | Compatible |
| :--- | :--- |
| Device Discovery | L0/L1/L2 |
| Device Info | L0/L1/L2 |
| Capture | L1/L2 |
| Registration Capture | L0/L1/L2 |

## Cryptography

Supported algorithms:

| Usage | Algorithm | Key Size | Storage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Encryption of biometrics - Session Key | AES | &gt;=256 | No storage, Key is created with TRNG/DRBG inside FTM |
| Encryption session key data outside of FTM | RSA OAEP | &gt;=2048 | FTM trusted memory |
| Encryption session key data outside of FTM | ECC curve 25519 | &gt;=256 | FTM trusted memory |
| Biometric Signature | RSA | &gt;=2048 | Key never leaves FTM created and destroyed |
| Biometric Signature | ECC curve 25519 | &gt;=256 | Key never leaves FTM created and destroyed |
| Secure Boot | RSA | &gt;=256 | FTM trusted memory |
| Secure Boot | ECC curve 25519 | &gt;=256 | FTM trusted memory |

{% hint style="info" %}
No other ECC curves supported.
{% endhint %}

## Signature
