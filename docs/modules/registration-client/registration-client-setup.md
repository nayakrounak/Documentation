# Registration Client Setup

This document contains the 'Registration Client' application initial setup, update and configuration process.

Registration Client application is a desktop based application, that can be used to captures the demographic and biometric details of a resident along with supporting information \(like proof documents & information about parent/guardian/introducer\) and packages the information in a secure way using RSA based algorithm. The information packet can be sent to the server in an online or offline mode for processing.

The registration client application leverages the TPM capabilities and secure the data and mark the senders identity in the request before sending to external system. The MOSIP server would validate the request and make sure that the request is received from the right source. Every individual machine's TPM public key should be registered at MOSIP server to accept and process the data send by them.

A Trusted Platform Module \(TPM\) is a specialized chip on a local machines that stores RSA encryption keys specific to the host system for hardware authentication. Each TPM chip contains an RSA key pair called the Endorsement Key \(EK\). The pair is maintained inside the chip and cannot be accessed by software. By leveraging this security feature every individual machine would be uniquely registered and identified by the MOSIP server component.

## Application build

OpenJDK version "11.0.8" version to build the application.

**Registration Client application is built with four different modules**

* registration-client - it contains only UI related code.  
* registration-libs - it contains the code to generate the initial run.bat.   
* registration-MDM-service - MOSIP Device Manager service to integrate with BIO device and render the required data in a standard format and that will be consumed by the 'registration-services' module.   
* registration-services - it contains the Java API, which would be called from UI module to render the services to the User and capture the detail from User and store it in DB or send to external systems through services.    

## Prerequisites

### System prerequisites

* CPU - Dual Core Processor - 2GHZ  
* Ram - 16 GB  
* Local Storage Disk Space - 500 GB 
* USB 2.0 ports or equivalent hub.  
* Physical machine with TPM 2.0 facility.   
* Windows OS \[10 v\] 

### Application Prerequisites

Before running the 'Registration Client' application, following prerequisites to be completed:

* Before building the 'registration-services' module, all the external [dependent services](registration-client-setup.md#dependent-services) URLs should be configured in the **'spring.properties'** and **'mosip-application.properties'** files.
* [Property file](registration-client-setup.md#property-file) - **\[spring.properties\]** should be updated with right environment \[env\] and other details.
* All **Master data** should be loaded at MOSIP Master database.
* User, machine, device & center mapping, and all other required table and data setup should exist in MOSIP Master database along with the profile and desired roles configuration in IAM server.

{% hint style="info" %}
Below are the mandatory master data mapping that should be available in master database.

* The centers and zone's should be created for the country \(in registration\_center & zone tables respectively\).
* The user id's should be mapped to a center & a zone \(in the user\_details & zone\_user table respectively\) and corresponding user credentials should be created in KeyCloak.
* The registration machines should be created and mapped to a center and zone \(in the machine\_master tables\).
* The devices to be used for registration activities should be whitelisted & mapped to a center and zone \(in the device\_master tables\).
* The corresponding history details should be also be populated for centers, zones, machines, devices & zone user tables, so that the validations in registration processor do not fail.
{% endhint %}

* User's machine should have online connectivity to access the client\_upgrade\_server, where the application binaries are available.  
* If TPM enabled, a logged-in user to windows machine should have permission to get the public key from TPM device.  
* Through the sync process, the data would be updated into the local database from the server.  
* All the required [dependent services](registration-client-setup.md#dependent-services) should be installed, up and running before running the client application.    

## Anti Virus - ClamAV Setup and Configuration in local machine

Installation of Open Source Anti Virus Software \[ClamAV\]:

* Download the ClamAV \(Version: 0.101.2\) Anti Virus Software - [link](http://www.clamav.net/downloads).

    * LocalIPAddress aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd\(Line 131\)  change to our machine IP address   
* Once all the Configurations are done run the freshclam.exe and then run clamd.exe. If required, restart the machine.

## Registration Client Installation

**Download - Application Initial Setup file**

* User downloads registration client zip from https:///registration-client//reg-client.zip. 
* Once downloaded then unzip the file into a particular location. It contains the following folder structure.  
  * bin: It contains the client UI and service binaries in an encrypted format.
  * lib: It contains the library required for the application to run.  
  * cer: It contains the certificate used to communicate with the MOSIP server. 
  * run.bat: batch file to launch the application.  
  * jre: It contains the java runtime engine along with the required DLLs. 
* Set "mosip.hostname" environment variable, with domain name being the value to be used by registration-client.
* Click the 'run.bat' to initiate the setup process.  

{% hint style="info" %}
"mosip.hostname" property can also be defined in the aforementioned file spring.properties of the registration-services module.
{% endhint %}

**When the user clicks on the 'run.bat' it does the following:**

* Communicate with client\_upgrade\_server through a secured connection and download the maven-metadata.xml file to identify the latest jar versions.  
* Compare the checksum of the local version of jar files with the data present in the Manifest.mf file.    
* Identify the list of binary files and Download the required jars.  
* Once download completed, decrypts the UI and service jars and start the application.   

**Application Startup**

* Once after application launches, TPM is initialized with RSA endorsement keys when TPM mode enabled / fallback implementation is initialzed \('reg.key', 'reg.pub', and 'readme.txt' will be created in your user.home directory with under .mosipkeys folder\).
* On initial startup, DB and DB pwd is autogenerated. DB password is secured using TPM key and encrypted db.conf is saved under .mosipkeys folder inside user.home directory.
* Use TPM public key / from readme.txt copy the public key and machine name \(hostname\) and use it in machine's update API.
* User should initially be online to validate their authentication against the MOSIP server. Post which, the sync process would be initiated.
* Once the sync process completed then restart the application to pick the local configuration.
* User should perform the self onboarding before start using the application.

## Update process

The application refers to the 'maven-metadata.xml' to verifies any new version exists or not.

mosip.rollback.path - Make sure that the rollback path is provided in this variable, which is available in 'spring.properties' file; as part of the **registration-services** module.

### Application update

* During the startup of the application, the software check will be validating against the maven-metadata.xml file from client\_upgrade\_server. If any diffs found, the application prompts the user with 'Update Now' or 'Update Later' options to install immediately or later. Apart from this, there is another menu option available in the application to trigger the 'Update' process post login to the application. The update process would update both the application binaries and DB.
* During the update process, the running application refer to the 'rollback' path and take the back up of 'lib, bin, MANIFEST.MF' files inside rollback folder with the new folder as 'Version\_timstamp' format. 
* Download and Update the required binary libraries and DB script into the existing running folder and restart the application.  

### Database update

The database update can be rolled out through the binary update process. If any changes in the script then the respective script would be attached inside 'registration-service/resource/sql/version folder \[like: 0.12.8\]' and deliver the jar with the newer version. During the update process, the jar would be downloaded and script inside the jar would be executed. It would also contains the 'rollback' {registration-service/resource/sql/version folder\_rollback \[like: 0.12.8\_rollback\]} script if update process to be rollbacked due to any technical error.

## Configuration

The application provided with the facility of multiple configurations for a different set of parameters. Each attribute level configuration changes should be performed at 'Config' server and same should be sync to the local machine through kernel services. Here few of the configurations are listed out that provide the facility to enable and disable the biometric.
