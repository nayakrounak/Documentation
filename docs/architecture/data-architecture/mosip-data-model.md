# Data-Model

This section contains details related to MOSIP data model design.The section also provides the data dictionary of the tables and columns defined by MOSIP databases.

## Data Model Considerations

* **Meaningful Naming:** DB objects that are being created will have a meaningful naming.
* **Flexible model:** No business rules are set at database level other than few mapping data. Most of the business logic is applied at application layer.
* **Database specific features:** Use of DB specific features like defaults, DB sequences, identify fields are not used
* **No business logic at DB:** No business logic implemented at database level other than PK, UK, FKs. 
* **Data Security:** Individual and security related information is encrypted
