# Biometric Data Specification

## Introduction

Biometrics images for various modalities are represented and exchanged as per the below specifications.

## Image formats

### IRIS Capture

Refer ISO 19796-6:2011 Part 6 Specifications.

| Factor | Registration Devices | Authentication Devices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rotation angle | Before compression, the Iris image will have to be preprocessed to calculate rotation angle. Refer section 6.3.1 of ISO 19794-6 for rotation angle calculation for rectilinear images. |  |
| Rotation Uncertainty | Refer ISO 19794-6 |  |
| Minimum Diameter | As per ISO 19794-6:2011 medium and higher quality images are only acceptable,. Hence for this Standard, minimum acceptable Iris diameter will be 150 pixels | Same |
| Margin | Same as ISO |  |
| Color | The iris images shall be captured and stored in gray scale with pixel depth of 8 bits/pixel |  |
| Illumination | The eye should be illuminated using infrared or any other source that could produce high quality gray scale image |  |
| Image Format | JPEG 2000 lossless | JPEG 2000 lossless |
| Aspect Ratio | 1:1 |  |
| Image Quality | ISO/IEC 29794-6 | ISO/IEC 29794-6 |
| Operation Temperature\* | -30 C to +50 C | -30 C to +50 C |
| EMC compliance | FCC Class A or equivalent | FCC Class A or equivalent |
| Preview | &gt; 3 FPS Jpeg lossless frames with quality score superimposed | Not Applicable |
| Image Specification | ISO 19794-6 | ISO 19794-6 |
| ISO Format | K3 | K7 |
| FTM | SBI 1.0 - Use host based security, SBI 2.0 - FTM supported security | SBI 2.0 - FTM supported security |

| Operation Temperature\* | -30 C to +50 C | -30 C to +50 C |
| EMC compliance | FCC Class A or equivalent | FCC Class A or equivalent |
| Image Specification | ISO/IEC 19794-5 | ISO/IEC 19794-5 |
| Exception Image Specification | Full Frontal with FACE features, two palms next to the face, waist up photo. 6X4 mm | NA |
| Image quality | ICAO - Full frontal image, +/- 5 degrees rotation, 24 bit RGB, white background, 35 mm width, 45 mm height |  |
| Image format | JPEG 2000 lossless | JPEG 2000 lossless |
| FTM | SBI 1.0 - Use host based security, SBI 2.0 - FTM supported security | SBI 2.0 - FTM supported security |

We recommend that countries look at ergonomics, accessibility, ease of usage, and common availability of devices while choosing devices for use in registration and authentication scenarios.
