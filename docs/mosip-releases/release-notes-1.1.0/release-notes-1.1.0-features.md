* New APIs have been created,
  * For creating, updating and fetching dynamic master data.
  * Dynamic master data has been added as part of registration client master data sync

## Administration

* New fetch APIs are added as part of Administration, so that drop-downs can be created for UI features.
  * Fetch a list of modules based on language code and id
  * Fetch a list of modules based on language code and id
  * Fetch a list of template types based on language code and code
  * Fetch a list of modules based on language code
  * Fetch a list of template file format based on language code
  * Fetch a list of template types based on language code
  * Fetch a list of location hierarchy list based on language code and hierarchy\_level
  * Fetch a list of location hierarchy based on language code
* Some create APIs are upgraded to support multi-language
  * Create an individual type
  * Create a holiday
  * Create a machine type

## Pre-registration

* Captcha has been implemented as part of login in pre-registration.
* Pre-registration UI now can be dynamically created using ID schema and UI specification. The guide to create   pre-registration UI Specifications is available [here](../../modules/pre-registration/ui-specification-for-pre-registration.md).

## Registration Client

* "Save to Device" feature has been disabled from registration client UI and will be added back when packet upload portal will be developed.
* Registration client is now sending the registration client version number as part of packet meta information.
* Login for user with role "Default" has been added, so that this user can skip on-boarding and register as the 1st user in MOSIP system.
* Client setting sync has been updated to fetch data only when key index and center id is sent. The updated API specification for client setting sync is available [here](../../apis/kernel-apis.md#sync-data-public).
* Machine master table has been updated to store public key and key index. Validation for public key to machine for TPM and non-TPM machines has been added.
* Support for dynamic fields in sync has been added. For details on dynamic fields find the API specification [here](../../apis/dynamic-fields-apis.md).
* Registration Client UI and flow now can be dynamically created using ID schema and UI specification. The guide to create the registration client UI specification is available [here](../../modules/registration-client/ui-specification-for-registration-client.md). The APIs to create and publish MOSIP ID Schema is available [here](../../apis/id-schema-apis.md).
* Registration Packet structure has changed to store id, evidence and optional data separately in different folders. 
* Implementation has been changed to support [MDS 0.9.5 specification](../../biometrics/mosip-device-service-specification.md).
* Implementation has been changed to support [SDK 0.9.0 specification](../../apis/biometric-sdk-api-specification.md).

## Registration Processor

* Secure zone notification stage has been added when a request comes from DMZ to MZ in Registration Processor.
* Implementation has been changed to integrate with [ABIS 0.9.0 specification](../../apis/abis-apis.md).
* In-memory virus scan of decrypted packets in DMZ has been removed due to security concerns.
* Feature to retrieve UIN card using UIN or VID has been implemented, so that resident services can provide e-UIN card to residents.
* Device validation for registered devices using which biometrics of resident were captured has been added in OSI Stage.
* Registration Processor integration with IDA internal authentication to perform officer, supervisor and introducer authentication has been added.
* Digital signature has been added to the UIN card.
* Packet processing is stopped for a packet which is marked as "Rejected" by the supervisor in packet validator stage.
* Registration client audit logs are now being sent to audit table after packet is decrypted in registration processor.
* Packet reader utility has been created to read the data in the new packet structure.

## Authentication

* Feature for multi-factor authentication is now added.
* Implementation has been changed to support [SDK 0.9.0 specification](../../apis/biometric-sdk-api-specification.md).
* Implementation has been changes to support [MDS 0.9.5 specification](../../biometrics/mosip-device-service-specification.md).
* Device validation for devices used for biometric authentication has been added.
* Authentication Transaction History table has been upgraded to support capture of entity ID and name of partners.
* Auto-revocation has been added for perpetual VIDs when regeneration is called.
* Audit logs for IDA events and ID Repository has been added for all failure and transactions.
* The design for IDA has been changed to make it Monolithic. Details about the design are available [here](https://github.com/mosip/id-authentication/blob/v1.1.0/design/authentication/Id-Authentication-Monolothic-Design.md).
  * Authentication as a separate module
  * Performance changes to IDA - Combining services for reduced network calls
  * Separate database for Authentication from the ID Repository
  * Zero knowledge storage
  * Caching for validations
