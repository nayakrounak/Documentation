# Hardware Sizing

The hardware compute and storage requirements for MOSIP core platform are estimated as below.

## Production

### Compute

Compute hardware estimates for a production deployment:

| Module | Capacity | n rServers | Configuration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Pre-registration | 7200 pre-regs/hour\* | 10 | 4 VCPU\*\*, 16 GB RAM |
| Registration Processor | 200,000 registrations per day | 80 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM |
| ID Authentication | 2,000,000 auth requests per day | 20 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM |
| Resident Services | 7200 resident services/hour\* | 10 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM |

\* Average throughput

\*\* VCPU: Virtual CPU

We estimate 30% \(approx\) additional compute capacitiy for administration, monitoring and maintenance. This may be optimized by the System Integrator.

**Notes**

1. High availability is taken into consideration with assumed replication factor of 2 per service pod/docker
2. The above estimates **do not** include compute servers needed for
   1. Database
   2. HDFS/CEPH
   3. [Bio SDK](../biometrics/biometric-sdk.md)
   4. [HSM](hardware-security-module-hsm-specifications.md)
   5. [ABIS](../biometrics/automated-biometric-identification-system-abis.md)
   6. Virus scan
   7. Load balancers
   8. External IAM
   9. Disaster recovery 

### Storage

Storage estimates for production deployment:

#### Database and HDFS/CEPH

[MOSIP Storage Requirement Calculator XLS](https://github.com/mosip/documentation/blob/master/docs/_sources/hardware_sizing/MOSIP_Storage_Estimate-v1.1.xlsx)

#### Appication and system logs

* Application logs

| Module | Unit | Raw log size |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Pre-Reg | 100 pre-regs | 20 MB |
| Reg Proc | 100 registrations | 200 MB |

The above estimates are approximate, and may inflate if, for example, there are too many exception traces.

The logs may be compressed and archived after a week or so. The compression ratio achieved with tar+gz utility is 15-20.

* System logs

To be estimated by System Integrator according to the deployment

## Dev, QA, Staging, Preprod

Additional compute and storage is needed for the following setups.

| Environment | Setup | n Servers | Configuration | Storage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dev | Sandbox | 13 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM | 128 GB SSD |
| QA | Sandbox | 13 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM | 128 GB SSD |
| Staging | Sandbox | 13 | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM | 128 GB SSD |
| Pre-production | Cell | \* | 4 VCPU, 16 GB RAM | \* |

\* To be decided by the country/System Integrator.
