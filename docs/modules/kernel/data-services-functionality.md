# Data Services Functionality

## Data mapper

Data mapper is used across MOSIP to facilitate mapping between DTO \(Data Transfer Object\) and entity.

## Data Access Manager

Data Access Manager provides a DAO \(Data Access Object\) interface to do the following:

1. Provide an interface for connection to a Database
2. Provide an interface to support Database CRUD \(Create, Read, Update, Delete\) operation
3. Provide an interface to support a custom SQL
4. Provide an interface to call Database functions.

## Sync Handler

1. Sync Handler allows registration client to sync Master data, List of User, Roles and Respective Mappings and Configurations \(Registration Client specific and Global Configs\).
2. Sync Handler also allows Registration Client to push data from Client local database to Master Database.
3. As part of Master data Sync, the service receives a Machine ID and Timestamp, looks for a mapped Center ID to that Machine ID and responds to the Registration Client with the Center specific Master data for the following tables.
   * Registration Center Type
   * List of Registration Center
   * Template File Format
   * Template Type
   * Templates
   * Reason Category
   * List of Reasons
   * Document Category
   * Document Type
   * Mapping of Applicant Type-Document Category-Document Type \(refer table "Valid Documents"\)
   * Machine Type
   * Machine Specifications
   * List of Machines
   * Device Types
   * Device Specifications
   * List of Devices
   * Location Hierarchy
   * List of Languages
   * List of Genders
   * Biometric Authentication Type
   * Biometric Attribute
   * Center-Machine Mapping
   * Center-Device Mapping
   * Center-Machine-Device Mapping
   * Center-Machine-User Mapping
   * Center-User Mapping
   * Sync Job Definition
4. The Sync Handler service only sends incremental changes based on the Timestamp received by the service.
5. For configuration, sync handler receives a request to sync configurations and will respond back with Registration Client specific and Global Configurations.
6. For User, Roles and Respective User-Role mappings, Sync handler receives Center ID and Timestamp and will respond to the Registration Client with Center specific incremental changes.
