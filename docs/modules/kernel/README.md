# Kernel

## Overview

Kernel is on which MOSIP services are built. Kernel is a platform to build higher-level services as well as a secure sandbox within which the higher-level service functions. Kernel provides a bedrock to build and run the services by providing several significant necessary technical functions so that individual services are concerned with specific business functions.

Kernel is not a distinct module but a bunch of services and libraries that are shared across different modules.

## Components

Refer to [commons repo/kernel](https://github.com/mosip/commons/tree/master/kernel) for all components of Kernel.
